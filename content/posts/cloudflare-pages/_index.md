title: 'Cloudflare Pages'
---

This website was built using Hugo, to generate the files that are served, Github, to have a repo where the code is pushed that generates these files, and Cloudflare Pages, to host these files.I will talk you through how to get things in order so you can get a website, like this one, up and running in x minutes.

## 1. Github
We start with creating a Github repository to work in.
If you don't have an account, you can create one [here](https://github.com/signup).

Once you've got an account, create a new repository. You can go to [the main website](https://github.com) and click the `New` button:


2. Cloudflare (and why not Github Pages)
3. Hugo (and alternatives)
4. Push
5. (Bonus) Your own domain name
