Hello, world! Welcome to my personal site. It's freshly created and I'm working on putting some content on here. Current things I'm working on include:

* Getting your own site up and running using Cloudflare Pages and Hugo
* uv, why it's cool, and how to use it
* Getting up and running with Stable Diffusion to create a logo for your team
* Running OCR on handwritten letters and creating a playground for applying LLMs to the resulting database.

I'll post on LinkedIn when I publish something new, so [connect with me](https://linkedin.com/in/thijsnieuwdorp) to keep in touch.
